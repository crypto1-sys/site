    <h1>Anastasy Mate</h1>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Anastasiaâ€™s Mate is a classical checkmating
         pattern where a knight and a rook 
         (or queen) cooperate to trap the opposing 
         king on the edge of the board. <br/>
         The knight covers key escape squares,
          while the rook delivers checkmate,
           often with the help of a pawn or t
           he edge of the board restricting the king.</p>
    <h3>Setup </h3>
    <p>The enemy king is usually on g8 (or h8).

A knight on e7 controls the crucial squares g6 and f5, preventing the king from escaping.

A rook (or queen) comes to the h-file (for example, Rh7#) to deliver the final blow.

The king is trapped against the edge of the board by its own pawn structure (e.g., pawns on g7 and h7).</p>
