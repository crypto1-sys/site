        <h1>Chapter 2 : Domain and range </h1>

        <h3>1.Review the lesson</h3>
<h4>Definition of a domain </h4>
<p> The set D is called the domain </p>

<p>Remark 1 : When we apply the function to an element x in the domain,
     the result is written as f(x) and is read as “f of x.”</p>
<h4>Definition of a range </h4>
<p>The range of f is the set of all possible values of f(x) as x varies through-
out the domain.</p>
