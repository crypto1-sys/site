    <p>An information system is a set of components that work together to collect, process, store, and distribute information.
      It helps organizations manage data and make decisions. 
      These components usually include hardware (computers, servers), software (applications, databases), people (users, IT staff), procedures (rules, processes), and networks (connections between devices).
    </p> <p>
In simple terms, an information system transforms raw data into useful information to support business operations, management, and decision-making.</p>
