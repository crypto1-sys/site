        <h1> Chapter : Social Engineering </h1>

        <p>In its broadest sense, social engineering is the 
            art of influencing human beings.
        </p>
        

        <p>Social engineers might try to make people believe that their "art" is based 
            on innate talent or natural gifts. This perception helps them appear exceptional and 
            reinforce their image as "geniuses"
        </p>

        <p> However, it is important to clarify that social engineering can be understood, modeled,
            learned and taught.
