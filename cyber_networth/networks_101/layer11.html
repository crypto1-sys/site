        <h1>Chapter 1 : The signal </h1>

<h4>Medium</h4>
<p>
    Telecommunications, i.e. remote communication, operates through a medium.
    A medium is a physical environment 
    that facilitates the transmission of information called a “signal”.</p>
    <h4>Devices</h4>
    <p>

At both ends of a telecommunication link, there may be devices that enable information to be encoded in the signal 
or extracted from the signal. These devices are called transducers. Some examples of transducers are microphones,
 loudspeakers, cameras, screens, sensors, actuators, etc.</p>
<h4>Signal and noise</h4>
 <p>
One might hastily conclude that it is the presence of information that distinguishes a signal from noise. 
This is not always the case, because a signal carrying information that is incomprehensible to the listener
 will be perceived as noise. And even when it is comprehensible, it may be perceived as noise by those who hear
  it without being the intended recipients.</p>
<h4>Network cable</h4>
  <p>
A network cable, which usually has four pairs, can carry four separate streams of information in either direction. 
Each pair carries its own signal, which is affected by noise caused by the proximity of the other three pairs, provided
 that they are also carrying a stream of information.
