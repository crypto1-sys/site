        <h1>Manchester coding</h1>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Manchester encoding is a method of encoding binary
             data for transmission, particularly in 
             digital communication systems.
             <br/> It combines the clock and data signals
              into a single stream to ensure synchronization 
              between the sender and receiver. </p>

              <h3>Understanding</h3>
              <p>

In most digital communication systems, you need two types of
information to correctly understand the transmitted data:
<ul><li>The data itself â€“ the actual 1s and 0s.
</li> <li>The clock signal â€“ a timing reference that tells the receiver when to read each bit.
</li></ul>


<h4>Two separate signals.</h4> 
The clock keeps everything in sync so the receiver
 knows exactly where each bit starts and ends. <br />
<h4>One code in Manchester</h4> 

But Manchester encoding does something clever: 
it encodes the timing (clock) directly into the data signal.
<br/>Instead of sending them separately,
   Manchester uses signal transitions to represent
    both bit value and timing information.

<br/>
Rather than sending one line for data and another
 for the clock (which requires more wires or channels),
  Manchester encoding sends everything through one single 
  signal line. <br/>


Because each bit has a transition in the middle,
 the receiver can easily detect the timing â€” 
 it can "lock on" to the rhythm of the incoming signal. <br/>
 This means the receiver doesnâ€™t need a separate clock 
 to stay in sync; it gets the timing information from 
 the data signal itself.<br/>

Without this synchronization,
 the receiver might read bits at 
 the wrong time and misinterpret
  the data â€” especially if the transmission is long or noisy.
