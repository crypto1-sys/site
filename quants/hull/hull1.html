    <h4>A corn futures contract 
    </h4> 
    
    <p>On June 5 a trader in New York might call
a broker with instructions to buy 5,000 bushels of corn for delivery in September of the
same year. The broker would immediately issue instructions to a trader to buy one September corn contract. </p>
<p>

At about the same time, another trader in Kansas might
instruct a broker to sell 5,000 bushels of corn for September delivery. This broker
would then issue instructions to sell one corn contract.
