    <h1>Ethereum and Bitcoin</h1>

    <h2>Main difference 1</h2>
    <p>Etherum purpose is not primarily to be a digital currency payment network.
    <br/> Sure! Let me break it down in simple English:

Ether is the digital currency of the Ethereum system.

It is integral (built-in, essential) and necessary (you can’t use Ethereum without it).

Ethereum is designed as a kind of “world computer” — a shared platform where people can run programs (called smart contracts).

To use this computer (for example, to run programs, send data, or make transactions), you must pay with ether.

👉 So ether is not just money like Bitcoin. It is mainly a utility currency — meaning its main purpose is to pay for computation and services inside the Ethereum network. </p>
<p>Think of Ethereum as a huge global computer that anyone can use. But just like your laptop or phone, it needs energy to run.

On your personal computer, you pay for electricity to keep it running.

On Ethereum, the “electricity” is computational power, and the way you pay for it is with ether.

So:

Ether = fuel (electricity) that powers the Ethereum world computer.

Without ether, the programs (smart contracts) and transactions on Ethereum cannot run.

👉 In other words, ether is both money and the fuel that makes Ethereum work.</p>
