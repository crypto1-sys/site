    <h1>Chapter 2 :Ethereum and Bitcoin</h1>

    <h2>Main difference 1</h2>
    <p>Etherum purpose is not primarily to be a
         digital currency payment network.
    </p>

<p>Ether is the digital currency of the Ethereum system.</p>



<p></p>It is integral (built-in, essential) and necessary
 (you canâ€™t use Ethereum without it).</p>

<h4>World Computer</h4>

<p>Ethereum is designed as a kind of "world computer" â€” a 
    shared platform where people can run programs (called smart contracts).</p>
<p>To use this computer (for example, to run programs,
     send data, or make transactions), you must pay with ether.</p>






<p>Without ether, the programs (smart contracts)
     and transactions on Ethereum cannot run.</p>

<p>ðŸ‘‰ In other words, ether is both money and the fuel that makes Ethereum work.</p>
