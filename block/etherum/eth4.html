        <h1>Chapter 3 : distributed state machine</h1>

        <h4>Definition</h4>

        <p>


A state machine is a system that has a state at a given moment and can change states when an event occurs.</p><p>

Example 1  an automatic door can be open or closed: that is its state. Pressing the button changes the state.</p><p>

Ethereum is a distributed state machine:

“Distributed” means that the entire network has a copy of the state.

Every time a change occurs (for example, a crypto transfer), 
the entire network agrees to update its state consistently.
