        <h1> How to Install Rust on Ubuntu/Debian</h1>
        <p> The recommended way to install Rust is by using rustup, the official Rust installer and version manager.</p>
        <div><img src="rust1.png"/></div>
        <p>1.curl is a command-line tool to download data from the internet.
Here it fetches the installation script for Rust.
<br/>
2. Options used <ul>
    <li>--proto '=https' → Forces curl to only use HTTPS protocol. This prevents downloading over insecure connections.
</li>
<li>--tlsv1.2 → Requires at least TLS 1.2 for encryption (stronger security).
</li>
<li>-s → Silent mode (no progress bar).
</li>
<li>-S → Show errors (so you see them even with -s).
</li>
<li>-f → Fail silently on server errors (prevents writing an HTML error page to your terminal).
</li>
</ul>

3. https://sh.rustup.rs

This is the official Rust installer script provided by Rust maintainers.
It’s just a shell script that knows how to download and set up rustup.
<br/>
4. | sh

The pipe (|) sends the downloaded script directly into sh (the shell interpreter), which executes it immediately.</p>
