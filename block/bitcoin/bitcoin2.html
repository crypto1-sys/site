        <h2>A digital currency called Bitcoin</h2>

        <p>In the Bitcoin system, the currency units are called bitcoins.</p>
        <p> These Bitcoins have a value with two properties
            <ul><li>Store</li><li>Transmit</li></ul>
        </p>
         <h4>1.Holding value (store)</h4>
<p>When someone owns bitcoins, those coins represent a certain amount of economic worth.<br/>
It’s similar to having money in your bank account or cash in your wallet.
 </p>
     <h4>2.Sending value (transmit)</h4>
     <p>Value is not just kept — it can also be transferred. 
If you send bitcoins to another person, you are moving economic worth from yourself to them. </p>

<p>The Bitcoin network records this transfer so everyone agrees on who now owns those bitcoins.</p>
