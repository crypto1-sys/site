    <h1> What is <em>Defi</em>?</h1>

    <p>There are many different ways we use our <strong>money</strong> in 
    the course of our life. Here some examples :
    <ul>
        <li>buying goods</li>
        <li>exchanging our local currency for foreign ones </li>
        <li>getting a loan </li>
        <li>investing in a company</li>
    </ul>
    All these transactions are facilitated by 
    financial corporations.<br> A typical financial corporations is a bank.<br>
    They are controlled and owned by a small group of shareholders. </p>
    
<h2>Centralized Finance</h2>
   

    <p>Since anything we do with our money is controlled by these institutions, 
        this system is known as centralized finance (CeFi) or traditional finance 
        (TradFi). <br/>This is the financial system we are all familiar with, in which 
        third parties control all our transactions while charging a fee for their services.<br>
         For example, whenever you buy a cup of coffee by card, you and the merchant are not
          the only parties involved in the transaction. <br/>Your bank, the shopâ€™s bank, and a financial
         network like Visa or Mastercard are typically involved too.
          And each party charges a fee for its service</p>
<h2>Decentralized Finance</h2>
    <p> Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers us all the same financial instruments and opportunities of
         traditional finance : <ul><li>buying goods</li><li>lending money for a yield</li></ul>  without any intermediary
          like banks or brokerage firms as they are replaced by blockchain and smart contracts.<br>
           Using DeFi applications, you will be able to <ul><li>lend or borrow crypto from peers</li><li> trade 
           crypto assets without any centralized entity</li><li>earn high interest</li></ul> 
             </p>
