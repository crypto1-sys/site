        <h1>Chapter : Earn Yield With DeFi: Lending  </h1>

   <h4>Main idea</h4>

<p> Exactly as you can do in traditional finance, one of the main ways to earn yield in DeFi is to lend your 
    funds to someone for interest. So 
    <ul><li>how does that work?</li>
    <li>How do you lend your funds to someone?</li>
<li>Is it safe? </li>
<li>How can you be sure that you’ll get your money back?</li></ul>   
    </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
If you had to lend $1,000 to a friend, you could agree to give him the money if he will pay it back after one
 year with a 10% yield. So your friend would give you back $1,100 after one year, and you would have realized
  a nice profit on your funds.</p>

  <h4>The problem of trust</h4>
  <p>
However, if you give the same $1,000 to a complete stranger on the internet, chances are you would never see 
your money again. That’s why if someone wants to borrow funds via DeFi, they must give collateral in exchange. 
</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
If I want to borrow $1,000 worth of USDC, I have to give $2,000 worth of ETH as collateral. 
This way, the other party knows that I won’t run away with their money.
