Those are also known as fiat-collateralized stablecoins because 
they are backed by money issued by governments.
<br/> This includes currencies like the USD, EUR, or GBP. As long as the economy of the currencyâ€™s 
country remains stable, so will fiat-backed stablecoins. 
<br/>
Fiat-backed stablecoins are collateralized 1:1.
 <br/>That means for every stablecoin in circulation,
  a single unit of currency ($1) is kept in a bank 
  account to back it up. <br/>If you want to trade in your 
  stablecoin for cash, you will receive the equivalent 
  directly from the issuer, such as Circle for the USDC 
  stablecoin, or purchase it on a crypto exchange like Coinbase.<br/>
   The stablecoins corresponding to the amount you retrieved
    will be taken out of circulation if you redeem them with 
    the issuer. </p>
