<h4>Stablecoins fiat-collateralized</h4>
    <p>  They are known as fiat-collateralized stablecoins because 
these stablecoins are backed by money issued by governments.</p>
<p> Example  :  It includes currencies like the USD, EUR, or GBP. As long as the economy of the currencyâ€™s 
country remains stable, so will fiat-backed stablecoins. </p>


<h4>Fiat-backed stablecoins are collateralized 1:1.</h4>
 <p>That means for every stablecoin in circulation,
  a single unit of currency ($1) is kept in a bank 
  account to back it up. </p>
  
  <p>The stablecoins corresponding to the amount you retrieved
    will be taken out of circulation if you redeem them with 
    the issuer. </p>
