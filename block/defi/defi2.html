<h4>Centralized Finance</h4>
    <p>Since anything we do with our money is controlled by these institutions, 
        this system is known as centralized finance (CeFi) or traditional finance 
        (TradFi).</p>
<p>This is the financial system we are all familiar with, in which 
        third parties control all our transactions while charging a fee for their services.</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p> Whenever you buy a cup of coffee by card, you and the merchant are not
          the only parties involved in the transaction. Your bank, the shopâ€™s bank, and a financial
         network like Visa or Mastercard are typically involved too.</p>
       <h4>Fees</h4>  <p>And each party charges a fee for its service</p>
