    <body><h1> What are stablecoins</h1>
        <p> Since the first Bitcoin block was mined,
             volatility has been one of the main problems 
             for the broader adoption of crypto. <br/>Popular 
             cryptos like BTC or ETH often reach dizzying 
             heights one day and plummet to gut-wrenching
              depths the next.<br/> Needless to say, the huge 
              volatility would have never allowed for the 
              mainstream adoption of blockchain. That’s 
              where stablecoins come in.<br/> 

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value doesn’t
 fluctuate, thus the name “stable.”<br/> They are stable because
  their value is based on and pegged to stable real-world assets.<br/>
   Usually, stablecoins are backed by currency like the U.S. dollar. <br/>

Those are also known as fiat-collateralized stablecoins because 
they are backed by money issued by governments.
<br/> This includes currencies like the USD, EUR, or GBP. As long as the economy of the currency’s 
country remains stable, so will fiat-backed stablecoins. 
<br/>
Fiat-backed stablecoins are collateralized 1:1.
 <br/>That means for every stablecoin in circulation,
  a single unit of currency ($1) is kept in a bank 
  account to back it up. <br/>If you want to trade in your 
  stablecoin for cash, you will receive the equivalent 
  directly from the issuer, such as Circle for the USDC 
  stablecoin, or purchase it on a crypto exchange like Coinbase.<br/>
   The stablecoins corresponding to the amount you retrieved
    will be taken out of circulation if you redeem them with 
    the issuer. </p></body>
