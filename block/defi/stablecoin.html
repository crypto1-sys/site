        <h1> Chapter 3: Stablecoins 101</h1>

        <h4>volatility</h4>
        <p> Since the first Bitcoin block was mined,
             volatility has been one of the main problems 
             for the broader adoption of crypto.</p> 
             <p> Needless 
             to say, the huge 
              volatility would have never allowed for the 
              mainstream adoption of blockchain. That’s 
              where stablecoins come in.<br/> 
<h4>What is stablecoins ?</h4>
<p></p>Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value doesn’t
 fluctuate, thus the name “stable.”<p>They are stable because
  their value is based on and pegged to stable real-world assets.</p> 
 <p>Usually, stablecoins are backed by currency like the U.S. dollar.</p>
